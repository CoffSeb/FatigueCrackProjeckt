# FatigueCrackProjeckt

This project was part of my internship at Aalto University CSM ( complex systems and materials) group. The projects aim was to study the fatique crack properties in aluminium alloys. The alloys that were studied where 1005 and 5005 alloys. The different specimens where also manufactured differently. These manufacturing prosesses inpacted the crystal structure of the alloys and thus affected the fatique crack properties.

My job was to study the spesimens with x-ray diffraction machine and to create program that can track the crack trough the aluminium spesimen while it experienses fatique stress sycles. The tracking software was made in matlab and run on the Triton supercomputer.

During the summer I cept a diary to track my work during the summer. Here is the daily work file in overleaf --> https://www.overleaf.com/read/cktmdvjknwgr

This document contains the tracking software and x-ray diffraction results.
